Evaluation Criteria (5-point scale):
Very Poor (1 point): The event arrangement is chaotic and unworkable. There is completely no scene description or merely extremely brief descriptions. There is a huge discrepancy between the role's behaviors and the events described. The expression is confusing.
Poor (2 points): There are many issues with the event arrangements, making it difficult to implement. Very few scene descriptions that are insufficient to build a basic visual image. There are some incomprehensible or impossible events. The correlation between the role's behavior and the event arrangement is weak, and the expression is somewhat confusing.
Average (3 points): Parts of the event are feasible with noticeable problems. There are a few scene descriptions but lack depth and detail. Most activities can be carried out, with only a few incredible elements. The expression is basically clear, the role's behavior generally fits the setting but occasionally there are vague or misleading expressions.
Good (4 points): The event arrangement is reasonable with minor issues. Generally described scenes, most activities are feasible with very few incredible details. The role's behavior fits very well with its setting, and the expression is clear and understandable.
Excellent (5 points): The event arrangement is thorough with only slight flaws. Rich and vivid scene descriptions effectively enhance the reader's sense of immersion. The event arrangement matches reality very closely, with almost no unreasonable aspects. The role's behavior is natural and authentic, fully consistent with its background setting, meeting all expectations, and expressed elegantly and accurately.
